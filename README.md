Reference implementation for phenopackets/PXF

See https://github.com/phenopackets/phenopacket-format/ for more details.

This provides a reference java implementation for PXF. Jackson
annotations are used to describe the mapping to the JSON serialization
of PXF. We are also experimenting with generating the JSON Schema from
the reference implementation.
